    <P><b>RE:</b> <u>Applying for a position of full-stack developer.</u> </P><br>
    <p>Dear Sir,</p><br>
<p >I am writing to express my strong interest in the Full Stack Developer position at Amazon USA.
  With a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and ongoing studies in a master’s IT program, 
  I bring a solid technical foundation and a deep commitment to producing scalable, user-centered 
  web applications. My hands-on experience with technologies such as Django, JavaScript,  React,
  and Node.js,as well as database management using both SQL and NoSQL databases, equips me wellfor this role.
<br>
<br>

  Currently, I am developing a portfolio of Django-based projects, 
  including a tourism-focused website aimed at enriching user experience through optimized design and 
  dynamic content management. This project has sharpened my front-end and back-end skills,
   as well as my familiarity with RESTful API design and implementation. Additionally,
   my work on various digital marketing projects has expanded my awareness of the importance of 
   user experience and customer-centered design in development processes.<br>
   <br>
   
As a proactive learner, I value Amazon’s commitment to innovation and am inspired by its dedication to 
customer-focused solutions. I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to Amazon’s projects and 
collaborate with an exceptional team.<br>
<br>

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to discussing how my background and
 skills align with Amazon’s needs in more detail.
   </p>
   <p>Sincerly</p>
